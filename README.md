Subject: Request for Approval of My Project - League of Legends Map Visualization

Dear Riot Games Team,

My name is Til, and I am developing a project that displays a visual representation of the Summoner's Rift map on a small external screen. The goal is to provide players with real-time information like champion positions and objective timers without offering any unfair advantage.

The Fog of War remains fully intact, and only publicly available data from the Riot API is used. The product does not reveal hidden information or give players an unfair advantage, as it simply shows data accessible to everyone.

I am committed to following Riot Games' guidelines regarding API use, data privacy, and brand rights. I would be happy to provide additional details if needed.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your feedback.

Best regards,
Til
